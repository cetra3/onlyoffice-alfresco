This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.4.0] 2018-07-11

### Fixed

## [1.3.2] 2017-05-01

### Fixed

* Issues identified when previweing excel documents in IE11 and Edge browsers are fixed, including:
  * User can't type in some letters in comment text area.
  * The placeholder text of search text field on right top of Share won't disappear when the search text field gets focused.

### Changed

Now in IE11 and Edge browsers, the editor of embedded type of OnlyOffice will be used to preview documents rather than editor of desktop type.


## [1.3.1] 2017-04-10

### Changed

* Remove the Javascript `trim` function definition as it's added only for IE 11 compatibility view feature, but user needs to disable this to make sure OnlyOffice works as expect, so this definition is not required any more.

## [1.3.0] 2017-04-10

### Changed

* Add timeout control to OnlyOffice Editor so that editor window can be closed after desired minutes if there is no editing happened to document.

### Fixed

* Can't use IE 11 to preview and edit document correctly

## [1.2.12] 2017-03-29

### Fixed

* Security Contexts are sometimes not cleared on the current thread by other webscripts.  This causes the lock and modification properties to reflect a completely different user.  Adjusting both the FullyAuthenticated and RunAsUser manually instead of a runAs callback resolves this.

## [1.2.11] 2017-03-23

### Fixed

* Transformations don't work if you are within a transaction. I.e, if you have a folder rule which does not have `Run in Background` ticked.  This now uses a special URL to access the content.


## [1.2.10] 2017-03-16

### Fixed

* Removed the use of Alf Tickets for callbacks.  Instead a HMAC token is generated per user, making the callback stateless and robust against server restarts and session resets.

## [1.2.9] 2017-02-28

### Fixed

* Above Preview Threshold message formatting fixed

## [1.2.8] 2017-02-28

### Changed

* Above Preview Threshold message is changed

## [1.2.7] 2017-02-28

### Changed

* Optimisations to XLSX threshold reader & LRU Cache for threshold lookup

## [1.2.6] 2017-02-13

### Changed

* No longer updating date/time when locking document (Reverts 1.2.3)
* Refactored the thresholds code

## [1.2.5] 2016-12-14

### Changed

* Documents that are above preview thresholds will no longer be previewed in Share
* Thresholds values can be set accordingly in alfresco-global.properties, the example settings are:
```
  onlyoffice.preview.document.size.threshold=10485760
  onlyoffice.preview.docx.threshold=8000
  onlyoffice.preview.doc.threshold=8000
  onlyoffice.preview.xlsx.threshold=10000
  onlyoffice.preview.xls.threshold=10000
  onlyoffice.preview.pptx.threshold=1000
  onlyoffice.preview.ppt.threshold=1000
```
* In the example settings above, document size threshold is 10Mb, the docx and doc threshold is max paragraphs number, the xlsx and xls threshold is max total rows of sheets, the pptx and ppt thresholds is max slides number.
* Any threshold's value will be 0 if they are missing in properties file. Therefore the corresponding threshold check won't be performed. For example, if `onlyoffice.preview.document.size.threshold` is not present in alfresco-global.properties, then there won't be any limitation in terms of document size when user tries to preview a document.

## [1.2.4] 2016-11-23

### Fixed

### Changed

### Changed

## [1.2.2] 2016-09-09

### Fixed

* The `Edit in OnlyOffice` action appears only if the document is unlocked or currently being edited inside onlyoffice.  This prevents the action showing if it's locked by something external (I.e, edit offline or edit in microsoft).
